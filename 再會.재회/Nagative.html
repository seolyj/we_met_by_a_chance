        <p>I know, when you quietly knock on the door of mt heart,
           I might have to let you drift away from my heart.</p>
        <p>My memories can't catch up with the fast runninf clock, The last moment I first notice you, I'll smile at you.</p>
        <p>light tiltingly shining is setting me on fire I tried to avoid becoming ashes, so I turned around The color of us was filling the missing parts It has become a beautiful movie without perfection.</p>
        <p>My heartbeat was in full bloom during the night we stayed together I was drawing you connecting the stars in the sky Though i'm coloring this moment with the color of us I maybe remembered as the name, First Love.</p>
        <p>The moon and stars even loved the blue sky of ours But now it seems like a shattered galaxy without no one touching it.</p>
        <p>Though I'm coloring this moment with the color of us I will be remembered as the name, First Love
