        <h2>Chapter #01</h2>
        <p>I didn't know I'd meet you on my runaway trip.</p>
        <p>I had a hard time with many problems, and although no one pressured me, I felt pressure from everything around me.</p>
        <p>So I became depressed. I was exhausted, with no courage left to start any task or stamina to continue interpersonal relationships.</p>
        <p>So I wanted to run away somewhere. The place we came to was a faraway country that we flew to for an entire day.</p>
        <p>I didn't want to bump into people, so I decided to go to a rural village with few people.</p>
        <p>I walked along the beach listening to the sounds of seagulls, and I also walked along mountain paths while listening to the sounds of birds.</p>
        <p>My heavy heart is gradually relieved by the peace I feel for the first time in a long time.</p>
        <p>On top of a small hill, there is an impressive cafe with a very large tree of unknown type.</p>
        <p>It was a leisurely cafe run by an old couple. I enjoyed the relaxation of this peaceful atmosphere while looking at the small, swinging empty swing.</p>
